Day 4: Camp Cleanup  

Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.  
For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:  

```
2-4,6-8  
2-3,4-5  
5-7,7-9  
2-8,3-7  
6-6,4-6  
2-6,4-8  
```
Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other.  
For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. 

Part 1:  
In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?
